Home Automation Infrastructure

This is a term project I did for a Real time computing class.

This is a very badly constructed set of programs that allows you to create your own DIY home automation system.
It was my first time writing python programs of any measurable size and I still wouldn't say I know python very well.
If a time ever arises, I'll rewrite this project.
